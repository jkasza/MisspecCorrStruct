"# MisspecCorrStruct" 
To implement the app locally, save the ui.R, server.R and MisspecCorrStruct.R files in a folder on your machine. Open up R, ensure that your working directory corresponds to the folder in which the files are saved, and that you have loaded the shiny, plotly, ggplot2, reshape2 and scales packages (and all dependencies). Then type "shiny::runApp()" at the command line.
